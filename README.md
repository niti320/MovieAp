**IMPORTANT NOTE**
The API key in the 
  "FetchMovieData.js, SearchResult.jsx, FavoritesMovie.jsx and TopRatedMovies.jsx" is private.
You use this app fully. You need to get your own API key from the OMDB.
Then you can either paste the API key directly in the Fields which say apiKey. Or create a .env file and store it there as enviornment variable.

Thanks.
